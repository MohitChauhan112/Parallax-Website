                  <p class="text">
                    Paragliding is an exhilarating adventure sport that involves flying a lightweight, foot-launched glider. Participants, known as 
                    paragliders or pilots, use the natural air currents and thermals to stay aloft and glide through the sky. Here's an overview of paragliding.
                    Paragliding requires specific equipment, including a paraglider wing, a harness, and a reserve parachute for safety. The paraglider wing consists 
                    of a canopy made of fabric and suspension lines that connect the pilot to the wing.

                    <br>
                    Paragliders launch from elevated locations, such as hills or mountainsides. The pilot lays out the wing, inflates it by catching the wind, and takes 
                    off by running or jogging down a slope. Alternatively, a winch or tow system can be used for launching in flat areas.
                    While paragliding is an exciting sport, it requires proper training and experience. It's recommended to learn from certified instructors, progress 
                    gradually, and adhere to local regulations and safety guidelines.

                    <h2 class="desc">SURFING </h2>
                  </div>
                  <p class="text">
                    Surfing is a popular water sport that involves riding waves while standing on a surfboard. Surfers harness the power of ocean waves to glide across
                    the water, perform maneuvers, and experience the thrill of riding nature's energy. Here's an overview of surfing.
                    Surfers use a surfboard, typically made of foam or fiberglass, with a streamlined shape designed to ride waves. They also wear a leash around their 
                    ankle, which attaches to the board to prevent it from drifting away if they fall off.

                    <br>
                    Surfers analyze the ocean's dynamics, such as wave size, shape, and direction, to choose the best waves to ride. Wave selection depends on a variety 
                    of factors, including the surfer's skill level and the type of surfing they wish to do.
                    Once on their feet, surfers use their body positioning, balance, and footwork to navigate the wave. They adjust their weight and make subtle movements
                    to steer the board and perform maneuvers like carving, cutbacks, bottom turns, and aerial tricks. Surfers can ride waves for short distances or go for long 
                    rides, depending on wave conditions and their skill level.

                  <p class="text">
                    Rafting and whitewater rafting are recreational outdoor activities which use an inflatable raft to navigate a river or other body of water. 
                    This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk is often a part of the experience.

                    This activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, if not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling 10 feet (3.0 m) to
                    14 feet (4.3 m) rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, 
                    or by the use of oars. 
                    <br> 
                    <br>
                    Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. Rafting is 
                    also a competitive sport practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting championship event between the participating nations.
                     The International Rafting Federation, often referred to as the IRF, is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport.
